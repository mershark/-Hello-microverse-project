<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Hello Microverse Project <a name="about-project"></a>



**Hello Microverse Project**  is a project, where I set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding was required for this exercise. My goal here was to master all of the tools and best practices I learned about in previous steps. In this Project, I created a GitHub repository "Hello-microverse-project" where I created" a feature branch "Hello Branch". I also set up HTML and CSS linters and added a Readme file, .HTML file, .CSS file, and a test.md file. I also made sure that the test.md file and node_mmodules folder weren't present in my repository.

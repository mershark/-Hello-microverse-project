<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Hello Microverse Project] <a name="Hello Microverse Project"></a>


Hello Microverse Project is a project, where I set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding was required for this exercise. My goal here was to master all of the tools and best practices I learned about in previous steps. I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is important to know them! I will also get my first code review. This is also a process that will be used in all Microverse projects.
